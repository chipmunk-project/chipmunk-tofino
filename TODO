# 1. How do we handle addresses in stateful arrays? Maybe transform it to some
# kind of equivalent scalar stateful form?

# 2. Maybe use the Domino compiler as a bootstrap for this? In the sense that
# there is no point searching in a grid that's larger than the grid that the
# Domino compiler requires. Related to Domino as a bootstrap, write a simple
# translator to turn Domino code into a canonical form for Sketch.

# 3. Setup some benchmarking infrastructure.

# 4. Is there any way to track progress of sketch?

# 5. Maybe the full spec doesn't compile (or doesn't compile within a timeout).
# But some modification to the full spec causes it to compile (e.g., deleting a
# line of code).  Then we can see if we can take the modified spec's compiled
# output and "patch" it to get the full spec's compiled output.

# 7. Could also add output muxes from stateless ALUs to PHV containers

# 8. Automatic conversion of Domino programs to spec files

# 9. Proofs of soundness and completeness of our optimizations

# 10. Try adding structure constraints as in https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/publications/synapse-popl16.pdf
# This is similar to Xiangyu's idea as well.
# The idea is that when we search a 5*5 grid, we don't search 4*4 sub-grids (which have already been searched)
# Again, we can prove the soundness of these optimizations using the tool in 9.
