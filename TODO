# 1. How do we handle addresses in stateful arrays? Maybe transform it to some
# kind of equivalent scalar stateful form?
# 2. Maybe use the Domino compiler as a bootstrap for this? In the sense
# that there is no point searching in a grid that's larger than the grid
# that the Domino compiler requires.
# 3. Write a simple translator to turn Domino code into a canonical form for
# Sketch.
# 4. Extract configuration of holes in human-readable form after synthesis.
